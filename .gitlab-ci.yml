# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages
variables:

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
#  - test
#  - push

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  cache:
    key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    paths:
      - node_modules/
  script:
    - docker build -t markhoffmansaw/todo-app-back:$CI_PIPELINE_IID .
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE' == "merge_request_event"

#push-the-image:      # This job runs in the push stage.
#  stage: push  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
#  script:
#    - echo "$REGISTRY_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$REGISTRY_USERNAME" --password-stdin docker.io
#    - docker push markhoffmansaw/todo-app-back:$CI_PIPELINE_IID
